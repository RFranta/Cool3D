						<!-- It is improtant however that the following conditions are met:
						<ul>
							<li>
								The model you want to upload is not too large.
								<ul>
									<li>
										This site is run by two normal guys, not a big corp.
										Hosting objects costs us money, and while we want to 
										provide hosting service for as many objects as possible,
										we have to ask that large objects are submitted via other
										means.
									</li>
								</ul>
							<li>
								You are the rights holder of the object
								<ul>
									<li>
										This is also important. If you are not the proper
										rights holder, we will be forced to take down the
										object if we recieve a DMCA takedown notice. This
										creates holes in the network for others who to help
										create a great network of objects. If you do not hold
										the rights to an freely available object, we suggest 
										you contact the author and ask that he submit it to
										Bld3r or link to a site where the author has
										uploaded the model already.
									</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>
								You understand that we may stop hosting your object if it is
								very unpopular for many months.
								<ul>
									<li>
										We totaly understand if you want to upload something
										obscure and interesting that may not be popular.
										We are really only worried about the expense of hosting
										unpopular/orphaned objects.

										We are modelers ourselves and we know that given a
										social network, others may not appeciate legitimate
										contributions.

										Again, however, hosting large files costs money. We
										cannot afford to be an unlimited repository for models 
										to download.

										If you feel your object has been over looked, and
										many will be, we endorse resubmitting the object to try
										get the attention of others, but please remember that 
										it's important you delete your origional submission.

										If you feel your object is continuiously overlooked,
										however, consider hosting it on your blog or website,
										and linking to your own hosting.

						<ul>
							<li>
								The model must be FREELY available.

										Freely means the model can be downloaded readily.

										example of a site to never link to: shapeways.com.
										Both are great sites, but for sharing, stick to free.

						Sdílejte odkaz na BitTorrent pro větší 3D modely. <!--It diversifies the hosting on peer computers
						and is, thus, not expensive for websites like ours to host.
						It also speeds up download times, as downloading from multiple hosts
						speeds up is one reason torrents are so popular.
						Unfortunately, we do not currently have the capibilities to safely,
						securely, and make sure we are legal when hosting torrent files.
						So, we can only, currently, host links sites that host these torrents.
						Many torrent sites are deamonized for hosting copyright infringing
						content, but for models with licenses that allow free sharing they are 
						perfectly legitimate. Some things, however, should still be considered
						if you are submitting a link to a torrent file: 
						<ul>
							<li>
								The content of the torrent must be clear, and as advertised.
								<ul>
									<li>
										Any flagged torrent links will be removed.
										The safety of our users computers is paramount.
										Torrents should contain only the advertised 
										model. We will ban any user submitting anything 
										that may harm a user's computer. We will report
										this to authorities. We will call you a jerk behind
										your back.
									</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>
								Please do not link to any torrent sites that host malware.
								<ul>
									<li>
										Unfortunately, due to the controvecial nature of 
										many torrent sites. They are often hosted under
										shady conditions. 
										Legitimate torrents may be hosted on sites
										and a submitter may be unaware that the site 
										is trying to install questionable material.
										If the site is endangering our
										users' browsers, we will have to remove the torrent
										link.
									</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>
								Please do not link to any copyright infringing material.
								<ul>
									<li>
										Any links to infringing material will be removed.
									</li>
									<li>
										Anyone who repeatedly links to copyrighted material
										will have his or her ability to submit torrent links
										restricted.
